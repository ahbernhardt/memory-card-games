### Rules
The rules and steps of the card game concentration are quite simple.

* How to match pairs. They have to be of the same rank and color (e.g. eight of clubs and eight of spades, king of hearts and king of diamonds, or both jokers, if used).

* Choose two cards and flip them face-up by clicking. If the two cards match, you win the pair and play again. If they are not a match, card would face-down and player continue this step.

* Concentration ends when there are no cards left to match.
